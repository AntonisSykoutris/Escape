# Roomi 

https://sykou3s-roomi.netlify.app/

I have created an Escape Room landing page to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following - 

## Semantic HTML
I used sematic HTML because it makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content.

## BEM methodology 
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable


## CSS Grid & Flexbox 
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.

## Sass

I used sass in order to make Roomi website modern and more professional.

## JavaScript
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.
